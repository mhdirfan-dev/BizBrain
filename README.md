## 🚀 What is BizBrain?

BizBrain is an AI-powered business intelligence agent that acts as a **strategic brain-for-hire** for entrepreneurs, small business owners, and startups. It digests everything about your business — products, competition, market, finances — and generates **psychology-backed, profit-driving strategies** grounded in behavioral economics, market structure analysis, and proven business playbooks.

Not generic advice. **Your business. Your moves.**

## 🎯 The Problem It Solves

Most small business owners in India make strategic decisions based on gut feeling. They lack access to the kind of strategic intelligence that large corporations get from expensive consultants. BizBrain democratizes that — putting a McKinsey-level strategic brain in the hands of every entrepreneur for free.

## 🧠 The Six Knowledge Pillars

BizBrain's reasoning engine is built on six intellectual foundations:

| Pillar | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 Human Psychology & Buyer Behaviour | Loss aversion, anchoring, scarcity triggers, IKEA effect, decision fatigue |
| 📊 Market Structure Analysis | Porter's Five Forces, Blue Ocean theory, niche identification, demand elasticity |
| 💰 Money Flow Intelligence | Revenue stream structures, high-margin vs high-volume tradeoffs, cash flow timing |
| 🏷️ Price Pattern Recognition | Penetration vs premium, psychological price thresholds, competitor pricing positioning |
| ⚔️ Competitive Battlefield Analysis | Weakness mapping, positioning gaps, counter-move playbooks |
| 🚀 Winning Business Strategies | Growth hacking, retention loops, upsell architecture, referral flywheel design |
